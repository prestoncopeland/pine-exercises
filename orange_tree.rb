# Orange tree. Make an OrangeTree class that has a height method that returns its height and a one_year_passes method that,
# when called, ages the tree one year. Each year the tree grows taller (however much you think an orange tree should grow in
# a year), and after some number of years (again, your call) the tree should die. For the first few years, it should not
# produce fruit, but after a while it should, and I guess that older trees produce more each year than younger trees...whatever
# you think makes the most sense. And, of course, you should be able to count_the_oranges (which returns the number of oranges
# on the tree) and pick_an_orange (which reduces the @orange_count by 1 and returns a string telling you how delicious the
# orange was, or else it just tells you that there are no more oranges to pick this year). Make sure any oranges you donâ€™t
# pick one year fall off before the next year.
